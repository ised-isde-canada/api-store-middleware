# APICan

APICan is API store management software to support the operations of the Canada API store https://api.canada.ca/en/homepage, a service provided and maintained by ISED. The Canada API store is the main hub for rest APIs, both public and internal to GoC. Each participating department is a 'tenant' and publishes and manages its APIs through the ISED API store. Each tenant is associated with a 3Scale account. 

APICan interacts with the following connected systems:

- Jira (Atlassian) for support requests
- keyCloak for authentication
- 3Scale for tenant management

It provides various tools to api store administrators within and outside ISED that facilitate the management of the Canada API store with respect to its various components, including: 

- its users
- its tenants
- its services
